##  Hi there!

👩‍💻 
I’m a data professional passionate about turning complex information into clear, actionable insights. I specialize in data visualization, business intelligence, and advanced analytics, helping organizations make smarter, data-driven decisions.

I enjoy building dashboards that not only look great but also solve real problems. Whether it’s uncovering trends through geographic data, automating workflows, or using AI to optimize processes, I’m focused on creating solutions that drive results and add value.

I’m always learning and looking for ways to improve, and I’m committed to using data to make a meaningful impact in everything I do.
